- Move the ``maps`` and ``mp`` folders into the ``Rush`` directory
- Open IW4x and launch the mod!

# Supported Maps

The only supported maps at the moment are
- ``af_caves``
- ``airport``
- ``co_hunted``
- ``contingency``
- ``dc_whitehouse``
- ``dcburning``
- ``estate``
- ``favela``

You can load a map with this gamemode by typing ``g_gametype rush`` into your console followed by ``devmap *insert map here*`` (For example, ``devmap co_hunted``)
